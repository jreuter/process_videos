# process_videos
Does some pre-processing of TV recordings before editing.

### Requirements

The default option for `post_process` is to send files/folders to the trash instead of a permanent deleted.  
This requires a 3rd party app `send2trash`.

Install Requirements.

```bash
       python -m pip install --user send2trash
```

For Python3:

```bash
        python3 -m pip install --user send2trash
```
